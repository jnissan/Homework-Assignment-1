		<p>The Sunder Seals are mysterious stones that have been recently found around the globe, nearly 75 years after a cataclysmic war destroyed modern-day civilization. Toby, Kellan and Heather live in a comfortable Confine when they hear about the strange events occuring outside the walls. When they come in contact with the Seals, they realize their destinies are much larger than they could've ever imagined. </p>
